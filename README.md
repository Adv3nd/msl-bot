• Inside MSL turn off all settings.

• Open up script and start a script.

## How to adjust bot
• Inside the bot, go to the debug tab.

• While in the map, check the Location: unknown.

• If it is says 'Location: map', you do not need to adjust.

• Uncheck 'Location'..

• If it is unknown whilst you are in the map:

  - Type "_CaptureRegion("test.bmp")" and click Test Code
  - An image file will be created.
  - Check if it is the map, if not uncheck Background Mode in the config.
  - Repeat the process.
  - If it is the same result, create an issue with the image file and mention your OS.

  - Adjusting images still work in progress...
